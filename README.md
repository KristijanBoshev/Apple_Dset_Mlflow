# Tracking various algorithms via MLFlow

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning algorithms applied to a structured dataset. I have employed a variety of techniques including GridSearchCV, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to achieve optimal performance.

## Features

- Implementation of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Utilization of Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms for classification tasks.
- Comparison between traditional models and neural networks.
- Integration of MLflow for experiment tracking.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is structured and well-organized, providing opportunities for exploring various machine learning algorithms. 

## Limitations

Due to constraints, the experiment server is stored locally in Databricks. If you require more details about the parameters tracking, please feel free to contact me privately.
