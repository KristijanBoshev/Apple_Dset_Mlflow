# Tracking various algorithms via MLFlow

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning algorithms applied to a structured dataset. I have employed a variety of techniques including GridSearchCV, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to achieve optimal performance.

## Features

- Implementation of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Utilization of Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms for classification tasks.
- Comparison between traditional models and neural networks.
- Integration of MLflow for experiment tracking.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is structured and well-organized, providing opportunities for exploring various machine learning algorithms. 

## Limitations

Due to technical constraints, artifacts generated during experimentation are stored locally and cannot be accessed directly from Databricks. If you require more details about the artifacts, please feel free to contact me privately.
